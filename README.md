# Text-pacticle-animation
Particle Typography is a p5.js sketch that creates an animated visual representation of the text "WERE STARS; WE FADE, BUT OUR LIGHT REMAINS" using particles that resemble stars. These stars appear to shine and fade away as they move across the canvas.

## Demo

You can view a live demo of this project [here](https://editor.p5js.org/Kwshr/full/pdYpQzx6Bd).

## Features

- Text is converted into a constellation of star-like particles.
- Particle movement is randomized for a dynamic effect.
- The color of particles changes as they age, simulating stars shining and fading.
- The sketch provides an example using the font 'YujiHentaiganaAkari-Regular.ttf'.
